# Pollution Analytics Dashboard: Bridging Data and Public Health Action

Air pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental health risks, contributing to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and premature mortality. Yet many public health agencies and medical professionals lack accessible tools to analyze pollution trends alongside local health outcomes—leaving critical prevention and policy decisions without data-driven support. 

To address this gap, we developed the Pollution Analytics Dashboard in Power BI—a dynamic, user-friendly tool that enables health authorities, clinicians, and researchers to:

- Visualize long-term pollution trends at the city level.
- Correlate air quality data with health indicators like asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular events.
- Identify high-risk periods and locations for targeted interventions.
- Export actionable insights for policy development and clinical decision-making.

By transforming complex environmental and health datasets into clear, interactive analytics, this dashboard empowers evidence-based strategies to reduce pollution exposure and improve community health—without requiring advanced technical expertise.

## 1. Pediatric Asthma Prevention Program

**Problem:** Our city's public health department lacks objective data to connect rising pediatric asthma ER visits with local air quality fluctuations. While regional EPA reports show generally acceptable pollution levels, clinicians observe asthma clusters following poor air quality days, creating a disconnect between official metrics and observed health impacts.  

**Solution:** Using the dashboard to:  
- Compare time-stamped asthma ER records with historical city-level pollution peaks.  
- Visualize temporal relationships between poor air quality days and subsequent admissions.  
- Identify seasonal patterns in pollution-health event correlations.  

**Impact:** Enabled data-driven decisions about school air quality interventions and physician alert protocols.

## 2. COPD Exacerbation Reduction Initiative

**Problem:** Pulmonologists tracking COPD patients across multiple municipalities need clearer evidence about how localized air quality variations affect exacerbation rates to guide clinical recommendations and community health investments.  

**Solution:** The dashboard helped:  
- Map patient exacerbations against corresponding municipal pollution data.  
- Establish qualitative relationships between pollution sources and health outcomes.  
- Compare patient outcomes across different pollution exposure zones.  

**Impact:** Informed patient education materials about high-risk periods and supported targeted policy advocacy.

## 3. Cardiovascular Health Protection Program

**Problem:** Cardiologists seek to better understand environmental contributors to rising hypertension cases, but lack tools to analyze population-level pollution exposure alongside clinical data.  

**Solution:** Using the dashboard to:  
- Examine geographic patterns in hypertension prevalence and pollution exposure.  
- Identify areas where pollution and cardiovascular risk factors co-occur.  
- Generate hypotheses for further clinical investigation.  

**Impact:** Created a framework for environmental risk assessment in cardiovascular care while maintaining scientific rigor about correlation versus causation.
