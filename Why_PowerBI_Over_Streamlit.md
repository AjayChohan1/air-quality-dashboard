# Why Power BI Was Chosen Over Streamlit: A Practical Perspective

The decision to use Power BI instead of Streamlit for the Pollution Analytics Dashboard was driven by real-world usability, security, and efficiency—key priorities for public health authorities. While Streamlit is a powerful tool for developers, Power BI offers distinct advantages for policy makers, analysts, and non-technical teams working with sensitive health data.  

## Key Reasons for Choosing Power BI

### No Coding Required
Health departments often lack dedicated Python developers. Power BI’s drag-and-drop interface allows epidemiologists and policy teams to analyze data without writing code.

Streamlit, while flexible, requires programming knowledge—creating unnecessary barriers for non-technical users.

### Built for Secure, Regulated Environments
Power BI supports row-level security, audit logs, and compliance standards (e.g., GDPR), which are essential when handling patient health data.

Streamlit apps, unless carefully configured, may expose data risks if deployed without proper access controls.

### Faster Deployment & Maintenance
Power BI dashboards can be shared instantly (via cloud or offline reports), while Streamlit apps require hosting, updates, and DevOps oversight.

Health authorities need reliable, long-term solutions—not prototypes that break when dependencies change.

### AI & Advanced Analytics Without Complexity
Power BI’s built-in AI insights (e.g., anomaly detection, automated correlations) help uncover trends that might be missed in manual analysis.

Streamlit can do this too—but only if a data scientist writes the code from scratch.

### Works Offline & Integrates with Government IT
Many health agencies still rely on Excel, PowerPoint, and legacy systems. Power BI fits seamlessly into these workflows.

Streamlit is web-based, which can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or strict IT policies.

## When Would Streamlit Be a Better Fit?

- If the goal was a highly customized, interactive web app for data scientists.
- For rapid prototyping in research settings where coding expertise is available.
